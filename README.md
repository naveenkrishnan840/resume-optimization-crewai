## Environment Setup

## Quick Start

1. Save your resume as PDF in the project root under the `knowledge/` directory:
    - Feel free to use the sample resume provided in `knowledge/knowledge/CV_Mohan.pdf`
    - I got it from [here](https://www.hbs.edu/doctoral/Documents/job-market/CV_Mohan.pdf)

2. Fill in the input data in `main.py`:
    - `job_url`: URL of the job posting (e.g., 'https://www.mckinsey.com/careers/search-jobs/jobs/associate-15178')
    - `company_name`: Name of the company (e.g., 'Mckinsey & Co.')

3. Run the optimization crew:

## Output Files

The tool generates three JSON files in the `output` directory:

- `job_analysis.json`: Detailed job requirements and match scoring
- `resume_optimization.json`: Specific suggestions to improve your resume
- `company_research.json`: Company insights for interview prep

## Architecture

The system uses three specialized AI agents:
